# Current Development Objective

## Goal: Tool Registry Architecture Redesign

We're planning a significant architectural improvement to move from our current function-based MCP tools to a class-based tool registry system, inspired by Serena's sophisticated architecture.

## What We Learned from Serena Analysis

**Serena's Strengths We Want to Adopt:**
1. **Class-Based Tool System** - Each tool inherits from `Tool` base class with `apply()` method
2. **Tool Registry** - Centralized discovery and management of tools
3. **Context/Mode System** - Different tool sets for different workflows (exploration, debugging, refactoring)
4. **Memory Management** - Persistent project understanding across sessions
5. **Smart Caching** - Content-hash based caching for expensive operations

**What We'll Skip:**
- Full LSP integration (too complex for our scope)
- Multi-language support initially (stay Python-focused)
- GUI dashboard (MCP provides UI integration)

## Major Milestone Achieved! ðŸŽ‰

**Phase 1 Complete**: We've successfully implemented the Tool Registry Foundation with advanced caching!

### What We Built

**Core Architecture:**
- âœ… `Tool` base class with standardized `apply()` interface
- âœ… `ToolRegistry` with automatic discovery and context filtering
- âœ… `CacheManager` with content-hash based caching strategy
- âœ… Automatic tool registration via `@register_tool` decorator

**7 Registry Tools Converted:**
- âœ… File Operations: `read_file`, `list_directory`, `find_files`
- âœ… AST Analysis: `analyze_file_structure`, `get_project_overview`, `find_function_usages`, `get_function_signature`

**Advanced Features:**
- âœ… **Context Modes**: Tools tagged for exploration, debugging, refactoring workflows
- âœ… **Performance Tracking**: Low/medium/high cost categorization 
- âœ… **File Dependency Tracking**: Automatic cache invalidation when files change
- âœ… **Backward Compatibility**: Legacy function-based tools still work seamlessly
- âœ… **Error Handling**: Robust error handling with ToolError exceptions
- âœ… **Cache Statistics**: Hit rates, entry counts, size management

### Performance Improvements

The caching system provides significant benefits for expensive operations:
- **AST Analysis**: File structure analysis results cached based on file content hash
- **Project Overview**: Full project scans cached until any Python file changes  
- **Smart Invalidation**: Cache entries automatically invalidated when dependencies change

### User Experience Enhancements

- **Enhanced `list_tools`**: Shows registry tools with categories and performance info
- **Enhanced `project_status`**: Displays registry statistics and cache performance
- **New `cache_stats`**: Detailed cache performance metrics
- **New `clear_cache`**: Manual cache management

## Current State Assessment

**What Works Exceptionally Well:**
- âœ… **Class-based tool system** with automatic registration and discovery
- âœ… **Advanced caching** with content-hash based invalidation
- âœ… **Context-aware workflows** (exploration, debugging, refactoring modes)
- âœ… **Performance optimization** through intelligent caching of expensive operations
- âœ… **Backward compatibility** - all existing functionality preserved
- âœ… **Enhanced introspection** with detailed registry and cache statistics
- âœ… **File operations with caching** (read_file, list_directory, find_files)
- âœ… **AST analysis with caching** (all major code analysis tools converted)
- âœ… **Git integration** with safety features (unchanged but still excellent)
- âœ… **Self-updating server** capability

**What Still Needs Work:**
- Git operations not yet converted to class-based (they work fine as-is, but not cached)
- Memory management system for cross-session persistence (Phase 2)
- Tool filtering UI based on active context (Phase 2) 
- More sophisticated cache invalidation patterns for complex dependencies
- Performance monitoring and optimization for cache size management

## Success Criteria

**Technical:**
- Tool registration is automatic and discoverable
- Tools can be composed into workflows
- Performance improves through caching
- Memory system maintains useful context

- Tools adapt to the type of work being done
- Common workflows become more efficient
- Better code understanding for complex projects

## Development Workflow Guidelines

**When Working on This Objective:**
1. **Update progress** in this file as phases are completed
2. **Update project_status** to reflect current implementation state
3. **Update CHAT_CONTEXT.md** when major milestones are reached
4. **Document design decisions** and architectural choices
5. **Update README.md** when new capabilities are available

**Progress Tracking:**
- Use checkboxes in the phase lists to track completion
- Add notes about implementation challenges and solutions
- Keep success criteria updated as we learn more

## Files to Monitor During Development

**Core Implementation:**
- `server.py` - Main MCP server registration

- `CURRENT_OBJECTIVE.md` - This file
- `CHAT_CONTEXT.md` - Session startup guide
- `DEV_GUIDE.md` - Development patterns
- `README.md` - Main documentation

## Testing Strategy

**Manual Testing:**
- Test tool registry with existing workflows
- Validate memory persistence across sessions
- Verify caching improves performance
- Ensure backward compatibility during transition

**Integration Testing:**
- All existing tools work through new registry

- Add features incrementally
- Maintain clear separation of concerns
- Document design decisions thoroughly

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Ready to Implement)
